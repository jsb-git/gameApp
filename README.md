# gameApp

This is a Game Tracker App use to track games that you are playing or not yet played. Use to keep track of backlog games.

Be able to do the following:
  - record number of hours played
  - record of when the is game bought
  - rate games
  - set or update the status of the game
  - create, edit and delete games.
  - sort and search for games

Probable improvements in the future:
  - schedule game time
  - find out the game currently playing
  - set game queue (so you will know what game to play next after completion)
  - filter status
